# Netherlands Bird Analysis

This is a comperative analysis of observations of pigeons and gulls in the Netherlands between 2013 and 2023.

The data used here has been dowloaded from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (https://www.gbif.org/) on November 17, 2023 from their EOD - eBird Observation Dataset.The DOI for the Columbiformes (pigeon) data is https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.9unn8n, and the DOI for the Larus (gull) data is https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.sqkufm.

This project was originally created as the Portfolio Project associated with Codecademy's Analyze Data with Python Skill Path. As such, it's main focus is to showcase NumPy, MatPlotLib and Hypothesis Testing skills, while also gaining insights into the trends of observations of two widespread types of birds in the Netherlands.
